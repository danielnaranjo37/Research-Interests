# Research-Interests
August 22nd, 2022. 

I've created this page to list out my personal research interests moving forward. My interests have been somewhat disjointed so far into my career, so I hope to change that, as well as demonstrate my knowledge in various areas of science and specifically in molecular biology and proteomics. 

This will consist of smaller postings where I list out and describe my understandings of various subjects and experimental routes  I'd like to someday carry out myself. 

Best wishes, 

Daniel Naranjo Sampson
